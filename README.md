In this repository you find the code accompanying the manuscript "Elucidating Fibroblast Growth Factor-induced kinome dynamics using targeted mass spectrometry and dynamic modeling".

The modeling is based on logic-based dynamic modeling that is incorporated in CNORode: https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.CNORode

In this repository you will find the following:

-**Data/artMS/** The data necessary for artMS analysis.

-**Data/systems_modeling/** The data necessary for logic-based dynamics modeling of all quantified kinases.

-**Data/ERK_optimized/modeling/** The data necessary for performing logic-based dynamic modeling of the optimized ERK activation pathway.

-**Scripts/artMS/** Scripting for artMS analysis.

-**Scripts/systems_modeling/** Scriptings for logic-based dynamics modeling of all quantified kinases.

-**Scripts/ERK_optimized/modeling/** Scripting for performing logic-based dynamic modeling of the optimized ERK activation pathway.
